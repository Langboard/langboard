# Langboard company development

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the
[fork-first development policy](docs/fork-first-development.md) before changing code.

- Haseong's split `Langboard/*` repositories own the architecture and source layout.
  Prefer their implementation; document a concrete requirement and evidence when a
  company change must differ. Do not treat the old monorepo main as current parity.
- Use one bounded feature branch/PR per owning component. Link dependent PRs for a
  cross-component feature. Do not accumulate unrelated tasks in one integration PR.
- Preserve existing work and the migration register. Do not delete, reset, rebase,
  force-push, close, or migrate another session's branch/PR without its authority.
- During this transition, keep existing integration PRs as the recovery and canary
  assembly path. Do not merge into `main`. Planned forks are not existing remotes;
  verify the repository map and actual GitHub state before using them.
- Push recoverable changes to their scoped PR. Record upstream baseline, local
  deviations, dependencies, validation, and canary evidence in that PR.
- Source merge, image build, deployment, and authenticated canary E2E are separate
  states. Close/archive a Langboard card only when its acceptance has been verified
  on the deployed canary; update its summary instead of adding routine comments.
